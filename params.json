  "body": "# RepRapTester - An Arduino Open Source 3D printable tensile tester (work in progress 2016 June)\r\nAn Open Source 3D printed tensile strength tester for testing 3D printed specimens using Arduino for about Â£30\r\n\r\nThings needed:\r\n  1. Arduino Nano/Uno\r\n  2. HX711 load cell amplifier\r\n  3. 300mm section of 51mm square aluminium tubin\r\n  4. 1 Stepstick/DRV8825 stepper driver\r\n  5. 10kg bar load cell 12.7mm * 12.7mm * 80mm such as this one: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13329\r\n  6. 4 3D printed parts\r\n  7. Nema 17 stepper motor\r\n  8. Flexible coupling (5mm at one end and 8mm at the other)\r\n  9. A section of M8 studding and a nut\r\n  10. 1 long M4 bolt and 1 M5 bolt\r\n  11. A micro-switch\r\n  12. A push-to-make button switch\r\n  13. 51mm of 6mm diameter steel rod (2 of these needed)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Arduino electronics and code performs the following stages:\r\n  1. Drives the stepper motor back to the limit switch\r\n  2. Drives the stepper motor to allow placement of the specimen\r\n  3. Zeros the load cell\r\n  4. Waits for pressing of Start button before starting the test\r\n  5. Drives the stepper motor at a set rate (specified in the sketch) whilst printing stress and strain data to the serial terminal\r\n  6. Stops after travelling 30mm (Assumes the specimen has already broken after this movement)\r\n  7. Moves the tensioner back by 5mm (the specimen holder dovetails allow this by being larger than neccessary) to allow the specimen to be removed\r\n",
